## My React Projects

Welcome to my React projects! As I continue to learn and explore the world of web development, I'm excited to share the apps that I've been building with React.

### Todo App

My first project was a simple todo list app. The goal of this app was to learn how to manage state in a React component and how to work with user input. The app includes basic functionality for adding and removing tasks, and it's a great starting point for more complex apps that require user input.

### Weather App

My next project was a weather app that uses an API to display the current weather conditions for a user's location. This project helped me to learn more about working with external APIs and managing asynchronous data in React.

### Movie Search App

In my most recent project, I built a movie search app that lets users search for movies and view detailed information about each one. This app uses an external API to fetch movie data and displays it in a clean and intuitive UI. It also includes features like pagination and sorting to help users find the movies they're looking for.

I'm excited to continue building more projects with React and sharing my progress along the way. Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
